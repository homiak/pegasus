Sky-Wrangler Artifacts

These are not mere tools, but instruments to attune your will to the spirit of the Pegasus.

The Nametag:
A vessel to capture a true name. Hold the tag to the open sky and whisper the name you wish to bind to it. Once imbued, present it to a Pegasus. This sacred act forges an eternal bond, ensuring your companion will never stray.

The Parade Wand:
A conductor's baton for the celestial herd. Touch the earth at two points to define a path. Then, with a quiet step and a gentle touch of the wand, command a Pegasus to begin its noble journey.

Use these with wisdom, for they touch the very soul of these noble creatures.
