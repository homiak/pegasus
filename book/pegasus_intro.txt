Pegasi are majestic, flying and 
fire-breathing horses. They 
can glow in the night and grow crops
very fast. They also interact very 
good with Water Dragons and break blocks.

Taming:
To ride a Pegasus, you must tame it by
mounting it and not get off until you see
green weird things flying around it. You
can also use the Dragon Water Bucket from
the Waterdragon mod.

Interaction:
After you tamed a Pegasus, you can ride
it, order it, saddle it... and so much more.
Keep in mind: you must be respectfull to this
creature, because if you aren't, it can
attack you or run away.
