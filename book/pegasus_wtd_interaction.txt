Pegasus interaction with Water Dragons

Pegasi and Water Dragons are nearly friends -
a Pegasus can ride a Dragon, for instance.
And a Water Dragon can rescue a Pegasus.
You should never attack a Pegasus if there
is a Water Dragon nearby, because if you 
attack it, the Water Dragon will rescue the 
Pegasus and attack you. And believe me, you
don't want to be attacked by such a strong
and massive creature. It will kill you in 
one moment.
