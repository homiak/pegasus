# Pegasus mod for Minetest/Luanti
This mod adds magical Pegasi to the `Minetest game` world — winged horses you can tame, ride, and befriend.

## Description
`Pegasi` are legendary flying horses inspired by Greek mythology. In the game, they roam the world, can be tamed and ridden, and even fly through the skies. They are more than just mounts — they interact with `Water Dragons`, follow their own paths, and have their own lore, recorded in a special `in-game book`.

## Features
- Pegasi spawn in grassland biomes
- You can tame and ride them
- Flight controls for flying and trotting
- Pegasi follow custom roaming logic
- Special interactions with Water Dragons
- In-game book with more lore and info
- Custom textures and sounds
