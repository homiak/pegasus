Initial release

## optional dependency "waterdragon"
The mod has an optional dependency on Draigh-Uisge (waterdragon) mod. When both mods are installed, Dragons and Pegasi will recognize each other in the world. Pegasi can use Dragon-like flight mechanics, and Dragons may respond differently to Pegasi. The interaction between these magnificent creatures adds depth to your mythical creature experience.

The mod is created by Scottii and based on "Animalia" by ElCeejo, "Draigh-Uisge (waterdragon)" by Scottii and on "Creatura" by ElCeejo.
