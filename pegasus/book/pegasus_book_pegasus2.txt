To tame one, you must feed it with wheat and
mount it (one or more times, if the Pegasus
does not listen to your commands)
and remain seated until the Pegasus
throws you off. Once tamed, a Pegasus 
can be saddled (or not) and ridden. Not
all Pegasi are created equal, some 
can jump great heights, while others can 
run faster. Pegasi will pass on these 
qualities to their offspring.
