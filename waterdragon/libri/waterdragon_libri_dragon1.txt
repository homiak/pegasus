Chapter 1: Dragons

Large and immensely powerful 
winged reptiles with a 
domineering presence. Across 
the world, in lakes and seas, Water Dragons 
reign at the top of the food 
chain. Their large wings propel 
them to great speeds, and their 
powerful jets of water
quickly take down enemies and 
prey.
